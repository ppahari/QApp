        <item>Android is the name of the mobile operating system made by American company; Google.It most commonly comes installed on a variety of smartphones and tablets from a host ofmanufacturers offering users access to Googles own services like Search, YouTube, Maps,Gmail and more.</item>

        <item> Android phones are highly customisable and as such can be altered to suit your tastes and needs with wallpapers, themes and launchers which completely change the look of your devices interface. You can download applications to do all sorts of things like check your Facebook and Twitter feeds, manage your bank account, order pizza and play games. You can plan events on from your phones calendar and see them on your computer or browse websites on your desktop and pick them up on your phone.

Another neat feature of Android is that it automatically backs up your contacts for you. When you set up an Android phone youll need to create a Google Account or sign in with an existing one. Every time you save a number to the address book of your Android phone it will be synced to your Google Account.

The benefit of this is that if you lose your phone all of your numbers will be saved. The next time you get an Android phone (or and iPhone or Windows Phone if you prefer) and sign in with your Google Account, all of your contacts and friends numbers will be displayed in your new phones address book immediately, no need to transfer or back them up anywhere else.

Syncing is a way for your phone to keep all your information, websites, contacts, calendar entries and apps up-to-date. This can happen over your phones mobile data or WiFi connection, seamlessly, in the background.</item>
